Back in the day, way before 1968, tennis wasn’t even a competition. It was more about tradition and having fun. The sport lived in black and white. And the players, well, it looked like they were heading to a party and not a professional game. To be fair to them, it wasn’t really a professional sport at the time, but those outfits were still outrageous. I’m talking about the pre-Open Era. This was one of the weirdest eras in the history of this sport. Why? Because this was the time when amateurs played the Grand Slams and professionals weren’t even allowed to show up. Yep, this happened. There was no prize money or any television deals for the players. The pre-Open Era was all about gentlemanly vibes and questionable fashion choices. Despite all this, the pre-Open Era still gave us some legends of the sport like Bill Tilden and Don Budge, who won all four Slams in one year before it was cool. And then finally came Pancho Gonzales. This era wasn’t about who was making the most money, because no one was. This era was all about being remembered by the fans. It was classy, enjoyable, and the fans loved it. But it was clear that the sport needed a big shake-up if it were to put itself on the map. And a shake-up is exactly what it got. In 1968, tennis finally opened its doors and decided it was about time they let the professionals actually play the game. Professionals met amateurs in the first ever championships open to both categories of player. The Open Era was born in 1968. The pros and amateurs were allowed to play together in the same tournaments. And let me say this, things got really spicy really quickly. Money started flowing into the sport. Television cameras started showing up at games, and the players obviously started giving it their all hitting the ball harder and running faster. The Open Era is what really put tennis on the map and turned it into a real sport. And just like that, tennis changed forever. We saw the rise of tennis icons like Björn Borg who can forget that ice-cold stare of his and that rockstar hair, John McEnroe, who’s basically the father of on-court tantrums, Martina Navratilova, Chris Evert, Pete Sampras, and Andre Agassi. The list is stacked with players who played a huge role in making tennis big. The ATP and WTA were formed to represent the players and to show the world what this sport really is about by promoting it. Not only this, but ranking systems were also established to determine who’s in deep water and who’s ruling the game. It wasn’t just another era in sports history. This was the big leagues. The sport got faster, the rackets got lighter, and the drama multiplied. The most important thing was not status, but the game. The Open Era gave tennis the swagger it always deserved. Because as the sport started to open up, so did the emotions. Players started showing fire. The fans started choosing sides. And the media also stepped up its presence big time in tennis because it started telling narratives as well, not just results. The Open Era set the tone for what was coming next, as it was the first time the best players were put up against each other for the world to watch. But what came next was something that nobody expected. After the Open Era came dominance, ruthlessness, and supremacy. I’m talking about the era of the Big Three of tennis, also known as the Golden Era. These three guys are the reason why every tennis argument ends up in a GOAT debate, because it’s hard to talk about tennis and not mention them: Federer, Nadal, Djokovic. Say these names at any tennis court in the world and everyone in the crowd will stop to listen. Roger Federer was buttery smooth on court. It felt like he was floating. The guy won 20 Grand Slams and had the most beautiful one-handed backhand you’ll ever see. No one in the history of this sport could do it like him. It’s easy to say that he owned the grass courts. Then came the pride of Spain, the king of clay, Rafael Nadal. He was a warrior on court. His energy unmatched, his skills unmatched, and his endless fight won him 14 French Open titles. And finally, Novak Djokovic. His mental strength was out of this world. He crashed Federer’s and Rafa’s party and went home with the biggest slice of the cake. Records broken, opponents dominated. The Serbian won everything there is to win in tennis, including the most weeks as the number one player in the world. These three share over 60 Grand Slam titles between them, over 100 unforgettable battles, and more GOAT debates than you’ll ever find anywhere else. But let’s not forget about one other guy who still left his mark in this era despite playing with such greats. Had he not played in the same era as the Big Three, his career would have surely been a lot different. I’m talking about Andy Murray. Don’t get me wrong, he still had an amazing career. From Olympic golds to a Wimbledon title, the guy did win a lot, but his career deserves way more love than it gets. Speaking of tennis GOATs, we can’t forget about the women who changed the game. While the Big Three made headlines, the women’s game was blowing up with brilliance. Serena Williams wasn’t just good, she was dominating. She has 23 Grand Slam titles under her belt. She played with power, grace, and always came up clutch under pressure. A true legend beyond the sport. While Serena deserves the bulk of the credit, she wasn’t the only one. Her sister Venus Williams broke barriers. Justine Henin brought artistry to the game. And Maria Sharapova brought the grit that was needed. The depth of competition was instantly high. Never forget the rise of players from all around the world as well. All of them truly put women’s tennis on the map. Old legends refused to leave the game and the new stars refused to wait as well. The late 2010s to 2020s was the transition era for tennis. New stars were born. Dominic Thiem won a Grand Slam in an emotional US Open final in 2020. Daniil Medvedev stepped in to deny Novak’s calendar Slam in 2021 with a clean game and a cheeky celebration at the end. Alexander Zverev, with his massive serve and lethal forehand, also showed promise. He won an Olympic gold but is still hunting that all-important Grand Slam title. Stefanos Tsitsipas, the Greek warrior with one of the cleanest backhands in the game, reached a Roland Garros final but has been plagued by inconsistency. Then came a second wave of players, with Matteo Berrettini throwing cannon serves and Casper Ruud reaching three Slam finals and silently climbing up the ranks. But Carlos Alcaraz was the real deal among them all. A fearless Spanish prodigy who made us believe that after the Big Three, this sport isn’t dying. We all saw his comeback against Jannik Sinner at Roland Garros. Carlos won the match against all odds and made a comeback for the ages. It was an unbelievable game, and in the end, the player who wanted it more won. Speaking of Jannik, he’s right in there too with the players who will change the game. He announced his arrival with the Australian Open title in 2024, and some fans are already claiming that he’s the best hard-court player who isn’t named Novak. The next era of tennis is well and truly underway with players like Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner on board. And the women’s game? That’s special as well. Iga Świątek treats us to Nadal-like dominance on clay. Coco Gauffbecame a Grand Slam winner before she even hit her 20s. It’s safe to say that the future of tennis is in safe hands. Despite all these greats, fans are still wondering if they’ll ever witness an era like Nadal, Federer, and Djokovic again or was that just a one-time thing? The game’s evolving and we’re witnessing the future right in front of our eyes. Because tennis today is not like it was a few years ago. It’s become faster, louder, and more global than ever. We’ve got superstars from Spain, China, the US, Poland, Russia, Canada. You just name a country and it probably has a top-50 player. There’s a new age of fans coming to the game. The courts are quicker than before, and new formats like Fast4, Laver Cup, and even mixed-gender matches are changing how fans experience tennis. From amateur battles to billion-dollar global tours, from wooden rackets to carbon-fiber weapons, from silence in the stadium to roars of the crowd these were all the eras of tennis we witnessed. And today we are witnessing greatness with future stars showcasing their skills day in and day out.
